			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					I'm a fullstack developer with programming experience of roughly <b>10 years</b>, born and raised in
					Germany. Due to my parents both sharing a mathematical background and proficiency in computer
					science, I suppose it's only natural that my interest for software development emerged at a
					young age.
				</p>
				<p>As with every journey, there's got to be a beginning - something to kick it off and set the ball
					rolling. Back in the days, my introduction to programming were graphical environments like
					<a href="http:////scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scratch</a> and
					<a href="https://www.generationrobots.com/blog/en/nxt-g-the-development-environment-supplied-with-lego-mindstorms-nxt-g/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lego Mindstorms</a>. You're given a set of command
					bricks which you can arrange and plug together however you like. Some might react to input, others
					may return output. This seems primitive at first, but you'd be surprised at how much a restriction
					of tools can push people to think outside the box. I was making tiny, tiny games on a heavy old
					laptop and it was amazing. Seeing your self-coded sequence play out in front of you, responding to
					keypresses, exactly as designed... it's really satisfying. That's <b>your</b> idea thriving and
					unfolding right before you!
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point I'd also like to include an honorable mention which really helped my brain ease into
					programmatic problem solving. You see, when I was five years old, my dad bought a PlayStation 3 and
					with it arrived a video game I would soon be obsessed with:
					<a href="https://www.mediamolecule.com/games/littlebigplanet" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Big Planet</a>, my beloved. Apart from an adorable design
					and story mode, players were able to make their own levels from the ground up and publish
					them for everyone to see. This collaborative and creative aspect only grew with the sequel by
					introducing circuitry, logical operators, custom input handling and more. It didn't feel like just
					a game, it was an entire <b>game engine</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the following years, my curiosity for information technology turned into a passionate hobby.
					I started researching and reading my way into <b>Java</b> to write plugins for a local Minecraft
					server. A few months later, I took the next big step and accommodated myself with industry game
					engine <b>Unity</b> and its variety of features. Lots of small game concepts which I had noted down
					in school I was finally able to realize, work up and build into standalone executables. Then, HTML,
					CSS, JavaScript - overall web design and development. Slowly but surely, I grew more confident in my
					hobby and it seemed to be getting easier and easier to learn a new language or framework. So I
					wandered from one small project to another, always just dipping my toes in and taking a new look at
					different areas of programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					From modern mobile applications to low level Arduino code, over games drawn using pure Java
					to entire web apps written in Dart and SCSS, I'd say there's pretty much nothing I wouldn't
					care to try out in terms of project type and size. Here's a list of languages I use for different
					types of projects:
